# Maintainer Guide

Start here when onboarding to make changes. It covers the repo layout, local dev setup,
the command cheat sheet, common workflows, and the CI architecture.

## Repository layout

```

├── pyproject.toml            # Poetry project + all tool config (ruff/mypy/pytest/…)
├── poetry.lock
├── src/file_mover/           # the application package (stdlib-only runtime)

└── .github/workflows/        # CI (ci.yml + codeql.yml + sonarcloud.yml)
```

## Local dev setup

Requires Python 3.10+ and Poetry.

```
poetry install                     # create venv + install dev tooling
poetry run file-mover --help       # smoke-check the CLI
```

The runtime package has **zero** dependencies; everything under `poetry install` is the
dev group (pytest, ruff, mypy, pylint, vulture, bandit).

## Command cheat sheet

```
poetry run pytest                          # run the suite
poetry run pytest --cov                     # with the coverage gate
poetry run ruff check                        # lint
poetry run ruff format                       # format (add --check in CI)
poetry run mypy src                          # strict type check (analysed as py3.10)
poetry run pylint src/file_mover             # lint (must stay 10.00/10)
poetry run vulture                           # dead-code
poetry run bandit -r src/file_mover          # security SAST
python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py         # regenerate docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md
python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py --check # CI drift gate
python scripts/pytest-by-requirement.py L2-CLI-003   # run tests for one requirement id
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh                # enable the pre-commit hook (once per clone)
```

## Workflow: adding a requirement + test

1. Add the SHALL statement to `docs/L1-REQ.md`, `L2-REQ.md`, or `L3-REQ.md` in the exact
   format the generator parses:
   - L1: `### L1-SYS-NNN` followed by a `**Verification Method**: …` line.
   - L2: `#### L2-CAT-NNN`, a `**Parent**: L1-SYS-NNN` line, and a `**Verification
     Method**:` line.
   - L3: `**L3-CAT-NNN** · Parent: L2-CAT-NNN · Verification: T, I` on one line.
   - If the category is new, add it to `CATEGORIES` in `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py`.
2. Write the test and tag it: `@pytest.mark.requirement("L2-CAT-NNN")`.
3. Regenerate: `python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py`, and commit `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`
   alongside the change. CI gates on `--check`.

## Workflow: adding a CLI flag

`create_parser()` in `src/file_mover/cli.py` is pure — no I/O, DB, or threads
(L3-CLI-001). Add the argument there, add a handler path, and cover it in
`tests/test_cli.py`. Keep machine output on stdout and diagnostics on stderr.

## Adding a config option

Options are defined once (from M2, via `OptionSpec`) and drive validation, docs, and the
`doctor` output. Update `config/file-mover.ini` and `docs/CONFIG-REFERENCE.md` in the
same change, and add a validation test.

## Adding an environment check (`doctor`)

Environment capabilities are strategies in `src/file_mover/diagnostics.py`. To add one:

1. Write a **detection helper** (module-level, so tests can simulate it):
   `def _my_capability() -> bool: ...`.
2. Write a **probe** returning `(available, detail)`:
   `def _probe_my_capability() -> tuple[bool, str]: return _my_capability(), "…"`.
3. Register it in `default_checks(...)` as an `EnvironmentCheck(name, Requirement.REQUIRED
   | OPTIONAL, probe)` — `REQUIRED` fails `doctor` (exit `ENVIRONMENT_UNSUPPORTED`),
   `OPTIONAL` only warns.
4. Test both branches by monkeypatching the detection helper (see `tests/test_diagnostics.py`),
   and trace it under `L2-ENV-*`. Never let a probe raise — `EnvironmentCheck.run` already
   turns an exception into a reported failure (L2-ENV-003).

## Adding a log call

Follow the convention in **`docs/LOGGING.md`** — stable `file_mover.<area>` logger, context
via `bind(logger, job_id=…, file_id=…)` (not the logger name), and gate by cost: DEBUG uses
`if __debug__ and GATE.debug:` (stripped under `python -O`), hot-path INFO uses
`if GATE.info:`, cold-path INFO/WARNING/ERROR call directly. Use `%`-style args, never
f-strings. Never install handlers — configuration is centralized in `logging_config.py`.

## Testing strategy

"Fully pytested" means more than line coverage: **every state transition and every
interruption/destructive boundary must have a test.** That principle — not the raw coverage
number — is the bar. Tests fall into five layers:

- **Unit** — components in isolation: configuration validation, path validation, manifest
  serialization, state transitions, retry backoff, hash calculation, collision policies,
  submission validation, source→destination mapping, error classification.
- **Integration** — real files in temporary directories: atomic claim, copy + publish,
  destination-hash verification, source deletion after success, source retention after
  failure, partial-transfer recovery, identical-destination reuse, conflicting-destination
  rejection, nested directories, and edge inputs (empty files, Unicode names, long-but-legal
  names).
- **Fault-injection** — raise a deterministic failure at each destructive boundary and
  assert the source survives: after claim, after job insert, during source hash, after
  manifest write, during copy, after destination flush, during destination hash, after
  publication, before source deletion, after source deletion, and before the final DB
  update. Filesystem ops, clocks, and repository interfaces are injectable so tests can
  force these exceptions deterministically.
- **Process-recovery** — start the service, interrupt it, and restart it with jobs in each
  non-terminal state; assert the job survives and reconciles (mirrors the acceptance tests
  in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- **NFS-representative** — behaviors a local tmpdir cannot reproduce (destination-mount
  loss, stale handles, `ENOSPC`, cross-client visibility, sustained ~100 GB). These are the
  deployment-time **NFS qualification checklist** in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, run against the
  real mounts rather than in CI.

Quality gates — the coverage floor, ruff/mypy/pylint/vulture/bandit, and 100% of
requirements mapped to a test — are enforced by CI and the trace matrix (see the cheat
sheet above and *CI architecture* below).

## CI architecture

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs, all via `poetry run`:

- **linux-container** — the full suite (unit, `doctor`, and the POSIX end-to-end tests —
  `AF_UNIX` control plane + `fcntl` lock) inside official `python:X-slim` Docker containers
  across 3.10–3.14. (GitHub Actions job `container:` is Linux-only.)
- **windows** — the full suite on the `windows-latest` VM (3.12 + 3.14); the POSIX-only
  end-to-end tests auto-skip, so this covers the cross-platform logic and the `doctor`
  suite. (Windows job containers are not supported by GitHub Actions.)
- **package** — `poetry check --strict --lock` + `poetry build`.
- **python-coverage** — the combined line+branch coverage gate (`fail_under` in
  `pyproject.toml`).
- **mypy** — strict, analysed as Python 3.10.
- **ruff** — `check` + `format --check`.
- **pylint**, **vulture**, **bandit** — lint, dead-code, security.
- **trace-matrix** — `build-trace-matrix.py --check`.

`codeql.yml` and `sonarcloud.yml` add security and quality scanning (SonarCloud requires
the repo be onboarded and a `SONAR_TOKEN` secret set).

The pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled via `scripts/install-hooks.sh`) runs
the cheap file checks plus ruff/mypy/pytest and the trace-matrix parity check, so failures
surface at commit time rather than in CI.

## Cross-cutting principles

- Runtime code imports **stdlib only** (L1-SYS-009). New third-party imports belong in the
  dev group.
- Never delete a source until the destination is published and verified (L1-SYS-003).
- Fail closed: no reduced-validation fallbacks; no `assert` for data-safety checks
  (L2-ARC-004/005).
- Prefer typed dataclasses/enums and narrow Protocols over `Any` and loose dicts.
